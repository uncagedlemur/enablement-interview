# There are several benefits to integrating Packer with Terraform.

![scale:10%](./assets/logos/packer_terraform.png)

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Synergy

- Streamlined Continuous Deployment
  
- Enhanced Scalability and Efficiency

???
## These include three key benefits that embody IaC methodology:

- Integrating Packer with Terraform harnesses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) synergy by combining Packer's image creation capabilities with Terraform's infrastructure provisioning, ensuring consistent and reproducible environments. 

- This synergy leads to streamlined continuous deployment, reducing complexities and enabling reliable automation throughout the deployment pipeline.

- The collaboration enhances scalability and operational efficiency by leveraging Packer's immutable machine images, allowing Terraform to efficiently manage infrastructure changes, promote quick scaling, and optimize resource utilization.
