# Enhanced Scalability and Efficiency

- Packerâ€™s ability to create immutable machine images ensures that infrastructure components are consistent and reproducible, allowing Terraform to efficiently manage infrastructure changes and scaling. 

- Standardize images wth Packer:

```
packer {
    required_plugins {
        ...
    }
}
source "<BUILDER_TYPE>" "<UNIQUE_NAME>" {
    ...
}
build {
    ...
}
```
