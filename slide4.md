# Enhanced Scalability and Efficiency

- Packer’s ability to create immutable machine images ensures that infrastructure components are consistent and reproducible, allowing Terraform to efficiently manage infrastructure changes and scaling. 

- Standardize images wth Packer:

```
packer {
    required_plugins {
        ...
    }
}
source "<BUILDER_TYPE>" "<UNIQUE_NAME>" {
    ...
}
build {
    ...
}
```
???
## Enhanced Scalability and Efficiency: 

- The collaboration between Packer and Terraform enhances scalability and operational efficiency.
  
- Packer’s ability to create immutable machine images ensures that infrastructure components are consistent and reproducible, allowing Terraform to efficiently manage infrastructure changes and scaling.

- This combination facilitates quick scaling by deploying new instances based on pre-built images, resulting in improved resource utilization and easier management of diverse infrastructure components across cloud providers or on-premises environments.
